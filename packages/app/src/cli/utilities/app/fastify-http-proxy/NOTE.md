This directory contains a modified version of [fastify-http-proxy](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-http-proxy) version 8.0.1 that adjusts the implementation to ensure proxied websocket events are sent as strings. Although we vendored the code to meet coming deadlines, we plan to contribute to the uptstream repository with some API improvements that allow configuring that through the public interface.
