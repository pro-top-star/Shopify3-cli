# Checkout-UI extension README

Checkout UI extensions let app developers build custom functionality that merchants can install at defined points in the checkout flow. [More info](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout)


## Prerequisites
---
Make sure you've completed the following prerequisites to develop a Checkout UI extension:

* You have a [Partner Account](https://www.shopify.com/partners).
* You created a [Development Store](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/development-stores) and [enabled the developer preview](https://shopify.dev/api/release-notes/developer-previews#previewing-new-features) for checkout UI extensions.
* Your store is populated with [test products](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create#step-4-add-and-publish-products-to-your-development-store-for-testing).
* You have an [ngrok account](https://ngrok.com/) and [auth token](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/auth/your-authtoken).
    * This is used to preview apps that contain UI extensions with Shopify CLI. More info inthe [ngrok’s documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs#config).
* You've created a Shopify app that uses [Shopify CLI 3.0 or higher](https://shopify.dev/apps/getting-started/create) (or you've [migrated your existing app](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli/migrate)).
* You’ve [Created](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/custom-banners/getting-started#step-1-generate-a-new-extension) a [Checkout UI extension](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout) that you can [Preview](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/custom-banners/getting-started#step-2-preview-your-extension) and [Deploy](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/custom-banners/getting-started#step-3-deploy-the-extension).

## Tutorials
---
The best way to get started is to follow some of the available Extension Tutorials:


For creating an extension:
* [Enable Extended Delivery Instructions](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/delivery-instructions) - Static Renderer
* [Adding Product Offer Recommendations](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/product-offers) - Static Renderer
* [Creating a Custom Banner](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/custom-banners) - Dynamic Renderer

To add specific features to an extension
* [Adding Field Validation](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/validation)
* [How to Localize an extension](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/localize-ui-extensions)


## Getting Started
---
Initially, your extension will look like the following:

```
└── my-app
  └── extensions
    └── my-checkout-ui-extension
        ├── src
        │   └── index.jsx OR index.js // The index page of the checkout UI extension
        ├── locales
        │   ├── en.default.json // The default locale for the checkout UI extension
        │   └── fr.json // The locale file for non-regional French translations
        └── shopify.ui.extension.toml // The config file for the checkout UI extension

```

Start writing code for your extension simply editing the `src/index.js` file (or equivalent file extension of your choice).

> By default, the Checkout UI Extension is preconfigured as a [`Dynamic Extension Point`](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout#extension-points).
> You can change it to your desired Extension Point location.


To shape your extension you have the following collection of tools available:
* [UI Components](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/components)
* [Shopify APIs](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/extension-points/api).

With these tools you'll get access to Shopify-enabled resources (such as [Analytics](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/extension-points/api#analytics), [Localization](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/extension-points/api#localization) or [Storage](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/extension-points/api#storage)) and the frameworks that you need to read (and mutate) data for your Checkout-UI extension (like Shop, Customer, CartLine, MetaFields, etc.).

> If you are using React, there is also a large collection of [React Hooks available](https://shopify.dev/api/checkout-extensions/checkout/extension-points/api#react-hooks) to ease access to these operations, otherwise you'll need to manually subscribe to the subscribable value directly with a callback.

## FAQ
---
* **How can I preview my extension**

    Depending on your extension location they may be either `dynamic` or `static` renderers, which diferr slightly on the process to place them for testing.
    - `Dynamic renderers`: Using a [query string parameter](https://shopify.dev/apps/checkout/test-ui-extensions#dynamic-extension-points) at the end of the URL you can place your renderer in the desired renderer point.
    - `Static renderer`: No special work is required here, just note that a static renders is shown only if the section that they are attached to is enabled.

* **How can I change my extension renderer type?**

    To change your extension render type, be mindful that you have to change it in the following places:
    1. In your `script file`, where you declared the extension (will be either _render()_ or _extend()_), you'll have to change the declared Extension Point.
    2. In your `settings TOML file` (shopify.ui.extension.toml) you'll have to change the `extension_points` declaration for your new desired type.
