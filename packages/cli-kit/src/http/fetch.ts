 * An interface that abstracts way cross-fetch. When Node has built-in

 * dependency from here.
 * Note that we are exposing types from "cross-fetch". The reason being is that
 * they are consistent with the Web API so if we drop cross-fetch in the future
 * it won't require changes from the callers.
 * @param url {RequestInfo} This defines the resource that you wish to fetch.
 * @param init {RequestInit} An object containing any custom settings that you want to apply to the request
 * @returns A promise that resolves with the response.
