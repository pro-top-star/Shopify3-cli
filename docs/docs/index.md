# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[new.docusaurus.io](https://new.docusaurus.io)**.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd docusaurus && dev up && dev server
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docusaurus/docs/index.md` and edit some lines, the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

If you have an existing microsite move the pages from the `previousMicrosite` directory to `docusaurus/docs/`.
For more information about migrating from a Jekyll to a Docusaurus microsite please refer to the [documentation](https://development.shopify.io/engineering/keytech/apidocs/microsites/docusaurus-migration).
